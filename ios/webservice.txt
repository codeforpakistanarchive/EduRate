So far there are two tables here. 
A city table and a school table. 
You can add cities to the city table and schools to the school table. 
To add: 
POST to http://canatan.site90.com/addSchool.php with a single form value schoolName 
POST to http://canatan.site90.com/addCity.php with a signle form value cityName 

To get: 
GET to http://canatan.site90.com/getSchool.php with no uid or a uid=someval 
GET to http://canatan.site90.com/getCity.php with no uid or a uid=someval 

if there is no uid for get methods it returns the entire table.
